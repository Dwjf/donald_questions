This page is dedicated to the questions raised by Donald, who asked me some questions about Christianity and the Bible. 
    <div id="question1"><p>
        <b><i>1. During Noah's time the flood destroyed the world because at that time the sin was full. Why didn't Jesus die for man's sin during Noah (much earlier) than during His appearance during the Roman Empire?</b></i></p></div>
    <div id="answer1">
        <p>First of all I'm impressed that Donald knew some parts of the bible and then came up with this line of questioning which basically critiqued the purpose of Jesus appearing and God's timing of it</p>
     <p>I believe, to understand Jesus's sacrifise for sins of mankind 2025 years ago, we would need to see the unfolding of history, and the various ways God deals with sin since the beginning of time, and the birth of Jesus Christ and his sacrifise and the final solution to sin. You need to look at God's plan throughout history , according to the bible, before the final solution , which is the sacrifise of Christ. </p>
     <p>God's plan thruout creation can be summarised in the bible, which consists of 66 books, divided into the Old testament and the New Testament, which records about 6000 years of history. Below is a table showing a summary of the books of the bible and when it was written</p>
